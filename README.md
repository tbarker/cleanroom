cleanroom
=========

Bootstrap shell script for a hygienic sysadmin environment

Cleanroom initialises a portable minimal XFCE4 desktop with remote administration and editing tools. It does not provide anonymous browsing or a full working environment.

You will need a Debian netinstall ISO, a USB stick and an ethernet internet
connection.

1. Make a base installation to your USB stick with the netinstall ISO. Use the "Guided - Set-up encrypted LVM" option.
2. Grab, examine (I'm just some random guy on the internet) and execure cleanroom.sh as root.
3. Read the post-boot instructions
4. Reboot the USB install
